An ML program i did for the Hac'KP hackathon July 2020-September 2020


 I used a dataset from kaggle 
 
 
 The dataset contained the crime records of that particular place
 
 
 The dataset had 5.6L entries/rows
 
 
 I used KNN for this project.
 
 Also added a database using SQL which is the kind of database one requires for optimum results in crime prediction
