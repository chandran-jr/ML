An ML program i did for the Hac'KP hackathon July 2020-September 2020


 I used a dataset from kaggle 
 
 
 The dataset contained the crime records of that particular place
 
 
 The dataset had 5.6L entries/rows
 
 
 I used just 2k for easier computing.
 
 I used KNN for this project.
 
 One particular crime outnumbered the rest due to which mostly the output is that outnumbered crime.
